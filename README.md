# simple ToDo List app:
made using Expo, React Native
allows adding a new task and deleting it (press it to delete)
## what might be useful:
- a task's page - date of creation, description
- move delete to task's page
- edit task option
- seperate list of completed tasks (or move completed to the bottom)
